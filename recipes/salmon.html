    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Fresh salmon needs very little preparation. These salmon fillets are cooked in good, sweet butter and minced
        garlic, and then sprinkled with a little lemon juice.</p>
    <p>If you'd like a little more kick and a fancy presentation,
        caramelize onions and serve them atop the cooked salmon.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons minced garlic</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon lemon pepper</li>
        <li>2 (4 ounce) fillets salmon</li>
        <li>1 lemon</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Season salmon fillets on both sides with lemon pepper.</li>
        <li>
            In a large skillet, melt butter over medium high heat. Stir in garlic. Place salmon in pan. Cook for 10
            minutes per inch of thickness, or until fish flakes when tested with a fork.
            Flip fillets halfway through
            cooking to brown on both sides. Sprinkle with lemon juice before serving.
